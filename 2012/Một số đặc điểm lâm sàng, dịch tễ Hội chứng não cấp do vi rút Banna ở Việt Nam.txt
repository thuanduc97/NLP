Summary:

Retrospective investigation of 205 patients with Acute encephalitis symptome (AES) 2001 to 2008 to determinine some epidemiological characteristics and clinical of Acute encephalitis syndrome caused by Banna virus. The results showed that: (1) The rate of AES in male was higher than in femal and accounted for 64% - 67% of the total number of infected cases; (2) Besides the general typical symptoms of AES, there were several clinical symptoms which had high frequency in patients with AES caused by Banna virus such as: bulging fontanel (23,30%), stiff neck (77,45 %), sign of Kernig (67,96%); (3) Most of general symptoms of AES has been reduced after one week, but symptoms of neurological disorders was still very high in patients with AES caused by Banna virus (55,34%); (4) Average duration of treatment for group of patients with AES caused by Banna virus was 13,5 days, which was longer than the group of patients with AES caused by Japanese Encephalitis virus and ECHO 30 virus; (5) Mortality rate of AES patients caused by Banna virus was very high up to 14,6 % (15/103). Vietnam. Therefore, it is necessary determine the molecular characterizations and the ancestor of Banna viruses circulatingin Vietnamese patients. In this study, a total of 717 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AES patients from 9 provinces/cities in the Northern, Central, Southern parts and Tay Nguyen, 2002 - 2012, ưhich was isolated by using monolayer cell line Aedes albopictus clone C6/36. Molecular characterizations of Banna virus in human were analyzed based on the coding sequence of VP12 gene. The results showed that out of 717 CSF samples, two Banna virus strains were isolated (2/717) in two different places (Thanh Hoa, Northern Vietnam in 2003 and Gia Lai Tay Nguyen in 2005). Studying on molecular characterizations of the VP12 gene showed that the nucleotide identitybetween two human Vietnamese Bannavirus strains and one Chinese strain was 90.6. It is an evidence to confirm that Bannavirus circulating in Vietnameses humans existed in nature and there was no close genetic relationship between Vietnamese and Chinese Bannavirus
